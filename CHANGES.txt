adhocracy Changelog
===================

1.2beta2dev
-----------
- Replace RabbitMQ/amqp with redis/rq. This means that you have to
  provide a working redis instance if you want to use asyncronous
  jobs (highly recommended in production).
  The background process that processes the jobs is renamed from
  'background' to 'worker'. You can call it with
  `bin/paster --plugin=adhocracy worker -c etc/adhocracy.ini`

  Configuration changes:

  * dropped: adhocracy.amqp.* settings are not required anymore.
  * new: adhocracy.redis.host: An IP address redis can bind to 
    (not a hostname!)
  * new: adhocracy.redis.port: The port redis will open
  * new: adhocracy.redis.queue: The queue name

- Give the users the option to permanently activate the twitter, 
  facebook or google+ buttons. Save the setting in a wildcard 
  subdomain cookie so it is valid across all instances.

  This requires a updated js.socialshareprivacy to work with
  our auth cookie. [csenger]
- add the possibility to overwrite templates in <adhocracy.site>/templates 
  directory (like it's possible for static resources and static pages already.
  New templates there need a server restart to be picked up.
